RUNNING THE PROGRAM:

To make the code run for precice. please mention the actual path in pathto in

 "pathto"/precice-1.1.1/src/precice/adapters/c/SolverInterfaceC.h 

 "pathto"/precice-1.1.1/src/precice/adapters/c/Constants.h

for the above both in main.c files and precice_adapter.h file. 

open the fluid solver in one terminal and execute the ./sim after compiling the files. This will wait for communication from the solid solver.
open the solid solver in another terminal and execute the list of commands in run_Solid_"problem_name" where problem name is the corresponding case running in the fluid solver.

In the case of heat exchanger since there are 2 fluids in consideration run the fluid solver in 2 terminals(one terminal for each fluid) and the solid solver in another terminal.

OBSERVATION:

CASE1: Forced convection over a Heated plate
	1. The temperature at the coupling interface reaches 4.83 degrees at steady state. The heated fluid is convected along the flow which is visible from the 			visualisation.
	2. The increase in temperature doesnt cause any change in fluid velocity/pressure as there is no gravity and flow is incompressible.
	3. The simulation converges for both explicit and implicit methods.

CASE 2: Natural convection in cavity with heat conducting walls:
	1. The simulation doesn't converge for the explicit case. The heat flux is very high due to small dx/dy and hence a very small dt is required for the 			convergence to happen in case of explicit coupling.
	2. The pressure is high at the bottom as the cold fluid moves towards the bottom. 
	3. The temperature is in the shape of inverted S this differs from the second assignment. This is due to the conducting walls at top and bottom in this case.
	4. A vortex is formed since there is a cyclic movement of fluid.
	5. Temperature are 322.725K on the left wall and 283.46K on the right wall.

CASE 3: 2D heat exchanger:
	1. The outlet temperature of fluid1 is 3.4 degrees. This increase in temperature is due to the transfer of heat from fluid2.
	2. The temperature of fluid2 decreases by 3 degrees. This is due to transfer of heat to fluid1.
	3.
