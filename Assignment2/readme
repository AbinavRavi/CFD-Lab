Once we finish with the execution of the code please write a short procedure of how to execute the code in this file.

We have to make changes as follows
  Output all vtk files in one folder so that we have the results to look at later period sorted
  we have to give a shell output (print) the following things on console after every timestep
    dt value, residual, No of SOR Iterations, and a warning message if the iterations have diverged from PPE
